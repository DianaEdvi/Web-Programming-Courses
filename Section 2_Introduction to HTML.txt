Introduciton to HTML

What is HTML
HyperTextMarkupLanguage
You can create a website with just HTML files.

HyperText: Text that can link to other documents (Hyper links)
MarkupLanguage: Pieces of text that tells you what to do with the text. HTML tags.
	Ex: Headings, body, etc	 

Tag vs element 
Tag: <h1>
Element: <h1>Hello World<\h1>

Not good practice to have more than 1 h1
Also not good practice to skip a heading level (h1 -> h3)

The Paragraph Element
Tag: <p1><\p1>

Void Elements 
Non void: paragraph, heading, etc. Not void bcs they have content in them. 
Void: forbidden from putting content inside the tag.

Ex: Horizontal rule element: <hr /> (draws a line) 
Ex: Break element: <br /> (line break)

Do's and Dont's: 
Don't use break lines to start a new paragraph. Use a new paragraph element. 
Use break element only when you want to separate lines in a single paragraph (like a poem or an address)

Note: You could write <hr> or <br> instead of with the slashes. Recommended to still use the slashes for easier readability.
