Cascading Style Sheets 

Style Sheet is a type of language. Allows us to specify how things should look. 
Other style sheets include SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet) and Less (Leaner CSS). 

3 ways to add CSS to your files 

Inline
<tag stylep="css" />
<html style="background:blue"></html>
background = property 
blue = value 
Useful for styling a single element on your page

Internal
<style>css</style>
<style>
	html{
	background: red;
	}
</style>

Applies to anything in the document. You need a selector (between curly braces)
Useful for only one  HTML document. 

External 
<link href = "style.css"/>

<link
rel ="stylesheet" (relationship aka role)
href="./styles.css" (location)
/>

#CSS file: styles.css 
<html>{
	background: green
	}

Much more versatile and most common. 

You can specify which elements you want which color. Ex instead of all html elements, you can write h1 for all h1's to be green

CSS Selectors 
Element Selector
h1{
	color: blue
}

The selector is the h1. Called an element selector. It selects a particular HTML tag. It applies to all elements that have that tag. 

Class selector 
.red-heading{
	color: red;
}
The red-heading is called a class. A class is something that we can add as an attribute to any HTML element
HTML: 
<h2 class="red-text">Red</h2>

CSS: 
.red-text{
	color: red'
}

Spelling is important.  

ID selector (#)
#main {
	color: red	
}
Selects all elements with a particular ID attribute. 
<h2 id="main">Red</h2>

CSS: 
#main{
	color: red
}

Difference between Class Selector and ID selector? 
Class can be applied to many elements. The ID should only be applied to one element in a single HTML file. 

Attribute Selector 
You can select elements with particular attributes to modify. 
p[draggable]{
	color: red
}
This selects all paragraph elements with the attribute draggable. 
You can even select the value of the attribute. (ex true or false)
p[draggable="false"]{
	color: red
}

Universal Selector (*)
*{
	color: red
}

It means select all.
