Section 7_ Intermediate CSS 

Cascade: The hierarchy, the order in which css rules get applied 

4 categories for prioritizing rules: 

The more specific, the higher the priority (the lower, the more specific)

These 4 categories are also prioritized in this order. 


Position: Is a rule in a higher or lower position in the code? 
Ex: 
li {
color: red;
color: blue;
}
Output = blue 

Specificity: How specific a selector is in terms of the elements
Element selector (ex li)
Class selector (ex .class)
Attribute (ex [draggable]) 
Id (ex #first-id

Type: External, internal, in-line 
External
Internal
Inline 

Importance: Keyword that you can add to force importance 
color: red;
color: green !important;

Combining CSS Selectors
You can select certain elements that are within a div by selecting the class of the div and noting the element within that div that you want to modify

<div class="box inner-box">
	<p>White text</p>
</div>

.inner-box p {
 color: white;
}

This selects all the paragraph elements within the divs with the class inner-box

Combining rules: 

Group: Applies to both selectors
selector, selector {
color: blueviolet
}

Child: First is the parent, the second is the child 
Only one generation deep. 

selector > selector {
color: firebrick
}

Descendent: ancestor and descendent
Can be multiple generations 

selector selector {
color: blue;
}

Chaining: apply where all selectors are true 
You basically add all the attributes that make up an element to be as specific as you want
Always start with the element, then go to class, id, etc

selectorselector {
color: seagreen;
}

Combining combiners 
selector selectorselector {
font-size: 0.5rem;
}

CSS Positioning 

Static: 
The html default 
Each item goes one after another 

Relative: 
Position relative to its default position

Absolute: 
Position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or top left corner of the webpage
z-index: determines which elements go on top of which in the z axis 
Everything has a default z-index of 0
Also, when you set it to absolute, the element is placed on a different layer than everything else 
**Important note: Make sure to set the parent to relative**

Fixed: 
Position relative to top left corner of the browser window 
(good for UI if you want to make a quick game)
