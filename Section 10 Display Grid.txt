Section 10 Display: Grid

Difference between Flex and Grid 
Flex: Aligns content along a 1 dimensional line 
Grid: Tool for laying out content on a 2D grid

Why bother with flex?
Most devs use a combo of them both

You can have a grid and within the grid is a flex, or vice versa. 

When shrinking, grid will automatically try and make a grid. They will line up. Flex will not, it prioritizes whatever spacing you wanted. 


display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr; (fr stands for fraction)
grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr; 
gap: 10px; 

grid-template: 100px 200px / 400px 800px (shorthand rows-columns) 
grid-template-rows: 100px auto; (tries to fit 100% of the space) 

Sizing 

Fractional sizing
grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr;

Minmax
grid-template-columns: 200px minmax(400px, 800px) (sets limit on the second column)

Repeat function:
grid-column-rows: repeat(2,100px)

Items are sorted left to right, top to bottom. 
If not enough rows/columns, it will fit the height to the height of the content and the width to the column height

grid-auto-rows: 300px; sets row height to automatic 300px


Grid item placement

Items are in a div. This div is called the grid container. 
The items are called grid items.
Rows & Columns are called tracks 
Within the intersection of the tracks, are grid cells
Multiple cells can make a grid item
Lines that separate tracks are the grid lines. Can control these with gap. Nothing else. 

grid-column: span 2; 

grid-area: 2/1/3/3 (row-start, column-start, row-end, column-end)
